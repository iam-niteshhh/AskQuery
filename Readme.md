# AskQuery 🧠📊

A simple, from-scratch project to build a natural language interface for querying CSV files — no transformers, no LLMs, just classic NLP + pandas.

---

## 📝 Project Description

**QueryCraft** is a tool that lets users upload a CSV file and ask plain-English questions like:

- "What is the average salary?"
- "Top 5 products by sales"
- "Show revenue trends by month"

The app will return:
- Text answers (e.g., "The average salary is $68,000")
- Visualizations (bar charts, line graphs, etc.)

---

## 📦 Tech Stack (planned)

- Python
- Pandas
- NLTK / spaCy (for rule-based NLP)
- Matplotlib / Plotly (for charts)
- Streamlit (for UI)
